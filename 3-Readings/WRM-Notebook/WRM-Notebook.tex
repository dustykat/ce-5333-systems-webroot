%%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Problem Statement}
%
%Figure \ref{} is a plan-view picture of a confined aquifer that has the shape of a square 10 km $\times$ 10km.
%Three sides of the aquifer have impermeable boundaries, the fourth side is a lake into which the aquifer drains.
%
%The lake water quality is poor, and to keep lake water from entering the aquifer minimum water levels in the aquifer along the lake are to be maintained.  
%These water levels are +0.64 m above the lake level in cells 21 through 25, and +0.95 m above the lake level in cells 16 through 20.
%
%The aquifer is recharged from rainfall that passes through the upper confining bed at a rate of $N=100$ mm/yr, uniformly distributed over the entire area.  Under natural conditions the entire recharge is drained through the aquifer to the lake.  The aquifer is homogeneous with transmissivity $T=1000~m^2/day$.
%
%Each cell in the diagram is to be considered a single point where pumping may occur (within that cell).  
%
%A consumer is located in cell 18 which represents the location of water demand -- all water pumped is routed to this center for use.
%The total water demand of the one consumer is $D = 7\times10^{6}~m^3/yr$. 
%The cost to pump and transport water from Cell 18 to the consumer is $ \$1.0/m^3 $.
%The cost increases with distance from the pumping area in Cell 18 at a rate of $ \frac{\$0.5/m^3}{1000m \text{~distance}}$.
%
%Determine a least-cost steady flow pumping strategy to supply the required demand and maintain the required water levels in the aquifer.
%\section{Solution Approach}
%The problem requires the ability to estimate the impact of pumping on the aquifer -- that is for a particular pumping strategy the engineer needs to be able to determine the water levels at each cell in the aquifer and check these against the minimum requires levels -- the simulation component.
%
%The problem also requires a way to select among different pumping strategies that if feasible (the simulation results satisfy the minimum water levels), are lowest cost -- the optimization component.
%
%The decisions to be made are the amount of pumping in each cell, and the total cost is computed from knowing which cells have non-zero pumping and multiplying these values by the price for pumping and transmission from that cell the to demand center.

%% Ted, one major difficulty in using captions for listings as shown here is that commas are used as an argument delimiter. If you require the use of the comma in a caption you will have to surrounded with braces as shown for the listing in example 1.  TeX will throw an error if you try to typeset it otherwise.

%\begin{lstlisting}[caption=R code demonstrating, label=lst:pre]
%txdot0_6654.db <- read.table("database_txdot0-6654.txt",
%                             header=TRUE, sep="|")
%DB <- txdot0_6654.db; # shorten the database name considerably

%"weibullpp" <- function(x, sort=TRUE) {
%    denom <- length(x) + 1
%    ranks <- rank(x, ties.method = "first")
%    ifelse(sort, return((sort(ranks))/denom), return((ranks)/denom))
%}
%XLAB  <- "NONEXCEEDANCE PROBABILITY"
%YLABV <- "VELOCITY, IN FEET PER SECOND"
%YLABQ <- "DISCHARGE, IN CUBIC FEET PER SECOND"
%\end{lstlisting}

%\begin{lstlisting}[caption=R code that needs a comma{,} in the caption{,} but remember that references to other listings can be made like this Listing~\ref{lst:pre}{,} which is responsible for setting up these examples, label=lst:exam1]
%# EXAMPLE 1
%#   ** Empirical Distribution of Discharge
%# Get all measurements for watershed area less than 1000 square miles and compute
%# the 50th percentile using the quantile() function of R---this is the median
%Q <- DB[DB$CDA < 1000, ]$Q; # condition as explained, note the comma

%#   ** Empirical Distribution of Mean Velocity
%# Get all mean velocities for which the cross-sectional area is greater than

%# greater than 30 inches and watershed area less than 750 square miles. Finally, want
%# to filter for discharges greater than the 60th percentile for the flow-duration curve
%# a the station. Again note the use of the comma, which is critical and the & means "and"

%VEL <- DD[DD$CDA < 750 & DD$MAP > 30 & DD$FDC > 0.60, ]$V; # watershed and flow prob.
