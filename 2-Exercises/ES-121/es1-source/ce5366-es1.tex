\section*{\small{Exercise}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Look up the term ``expected value'' in the actuarial and/or financial context.
\item Consider a decision (action) with the properties below \\ ~\\
\begin{tabular}{cll}
Action & Outcome & Probability \\
\hline
\hline
A & 200,000 live; 400,000 die & 100\% \\
B & 198,000 live; 402,000 die & 100\% \\
\end{tabular}\\~\\
Compute the expected value of the number of lives in each alternative.
Suppose the decision makers goal is to maximize the expected value of number of lives.
Suppose the ``cost'' to implement either action is identical.
Which action would you choose? Why?

Suppose the decision makers goal is to maximize the expected value of number of lives.
Suppose the ``cost'' to implement action A has a cost, equivalent to two thousand premature deaths within ten years of the action.
Which action would you choose? Why?

\item Did ``cost'' have an effect on \textbf{your} decision?   
\item Did the timing of the cost have an effect on \textbf{your} decision?   
\item Look up the term ``triage'' as it is applied to military (battlefield) medicine.  How might this concept apply in the cases above?
